In the star system, there are three worlds.
Natura, a world powered by an enchanted tree in the center of the world. This tree enchants the ores within the mines, bringing the ores to life, giving them human-like qualities. Their leader is Dynamo of Fate, A being of time and fire. He is not a god - His powers were gifted to him from the gods to protect this world, as he was one of the first to come to life.
Caverna, an underground mining city with the city's citizens being ores themselves.
The houses are carved from the stone of the mines, with most of their day to day items made from local materials. Natura is far from here, and usually only beings with powers of teleportation move through these worlds. Their leader, Retina, is a glitched eye-like being of the Void. He is a Demi-God of the Void, able to warp items to his will.
Luna Refuge is the moon of Natura, home to the most powerful beings in this star system. Life here does not need oxygen, as it is a moon. NILNAL, a being of nothing and emptiness composed of antimatter. He has no powers, but his body composition destroys everything he comes in contact with. He can create antimatter equivalents of most objects, allowing to live a somewhat normal life. Epinephrine, a being of pure adrenaline with the ability to alter the composition of items to destory or change them altogether. She is ashamed of her Demi-God status and wishes she was just a normal citizen. Together they are the leaders of Luna Refuge
