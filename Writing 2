The night I committed suicide, I made my bed. I took the clean sheets out of the dryer and stretched the sheet on, I put the pillows on the headboard and laid a large blanket over top.
The night I committed suicide, I fed my cat. I grabbed the scoop, put the clumps in a bag, and threw them away. I gave him kibble with tuna and water. I crouched down as he purred gently.
The night I committed suicide, I showered. I undressed and cleaned my body, I wrapped up in a soft towel and stood above the sink as I brushed my teeth. I put on night clothes and headed into my room.
The moment I committed suicide, I felt at ease. My cat was sitting on my chest. The last thing I heard was his soft purr. 
The morning after I committed suicide, I got up. I sat there, eating eggs and bacon with cheese grits. They tasted like nothing. I spit them out in the garbage.
The morning after I committed suicide, I fed my cat. I made the usual kibble with tuna and water, but he didn't come to the sound of the can popping. He only wandered into the kitchen 30 minutes later, looking around.
The morning after I committed suicide, I took out the trash. I closed the bag and tied the strings together. I picked it up and put it in the outdoor bin. I wheeled the can to the front of my driveway.
The morning was uneventful. It was all the same. I did everything like I usually did.
